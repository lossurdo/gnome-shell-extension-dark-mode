# gnome-shell-extension-dark-mode
Switch GNOME 3 theme to Dark Mode and back.

![Example](https://github.com/lossurdo/gnome-shell-extension-dark-mode/blob/master/src/dark-mode-screenshot.png "Example")

### Warning
This extension is still a BETA version. It only supports **Adwaita** and **Adwaita-dark** for now. I'm working on a new version where you can choose what theme you prefer for a dark and non-dark mode.

### Tested on

* Fedora 30 - GNOME 3.32.2
* Fedora 31 - GNOME 3.34.1
* Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS - GNOME 3.28.2
* Debian 10.1 Buster - GNOME 3.30.2

### How to install?

* Access [GNOME Shell Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2314/dark-mode-switcher/) site.
* If you have GNOME Shell integration set, you only have to switch the toggle on.
* If you do not have GNOME Shell integration, you must have to follow a few more steps: [Look this tutorial](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-shell-extensions/)
